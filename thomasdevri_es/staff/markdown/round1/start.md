# Congratulations

SQL Injection, expert poking-aroundedness, and a throwback to the life of 2005
text messaging. Not bad. Not. Bad. At All. I must say I am quite impressed, but
I could not let you get that off too easy. Now that you know what I have at
my disposal, let us enter three rounds of true challenges for you to earn
the right to truly take control of this server for yourself.

Let's review. I have:

- A means for creating thicc, deeply hidden pages on this site with arbitrary
  names.
- A backend for spinning up a frightening number of TCP socket servers. Like
  honestly, I can't wait for you to see the genuine software I wrote for this.
  I am so pleased with myself.

# Round 1 Challenge

Can you believe it is your twentieth birthday here on the good ol' planet earth?
What a hoot-and-a-half, and I right? What better way to celebrate such an occasion
than to think back on the volume of presents of christmas past! How many presents
do you think you got on the average year? 10? 20? 30?? Let's be conservative
and skip counting every stocking stuffer.

With a mother as generous as ours, my memory informs me that 15 presents per
year, for a total of 300 in your lifetime seems a quite reasonable number. In
memory of each present, I grant you one single `utf-8` character, coming
together to form a wonderful 300-character random string – not unlike a string
of christmas lights – reminding you of those joyful times.

Advancing to the next challenge will be simple. All you need to do is visit
the following URL:

At this point, you surely are wondering to yourself, "but Jack, where
are these characters of which you speak??" Well, I wouldn't want to
overburden my servers. I think it's best to keep it down to one character
per port. Of course, when deploying a swarm of 300 TCP servers, it is simply
irresponsible to try to strictly allocate a fixed port. Let the operating
system do what it was meant to do! I'm sure you will figure it out!

The root node port is equal to the number of meters from my bedroom in hoboken
to your gaming computer, as the crow flies.
