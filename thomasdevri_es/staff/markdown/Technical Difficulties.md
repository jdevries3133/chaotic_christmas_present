# So, you made it into the staff site.

Very nice! You are well on your way. Unfortunately, as you can tell by poking
around here, this part of the puzzle is dependent on many, many, .... *many*
TCP servers running simultaneously. Unfortunately, my smol 1gb of ram server
basically went into cardiac arrest overnight just trying to keep that many
things alive and I awoke this morning to the server having crashed overnight.

I need to switch the server to a bigger machine, which I will do ASAP, but for
now sit tight and think about what future lies in store for you. Thank you
for your understanding :)
