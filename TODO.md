# TODO

> Current to do list

## Site Style

- [ ] Base styling (+ site navigation)
- [ ] Home page
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] Staff login

## "Employee Dashboard"

### Styling

- [ ] Fake bells and whistles

### Content

- [ ] "Top Secret" experimental TCP protocols

### Hierarchy of "Experimental TCP Protocols" "documentation" documentation

- `/staff/tcpicism`
  - Silly marketing
  - "TCP was meant to be extended. When you can't afford 10 extra CPU cycles
    to parse json into a cogent data structure, our TCP3000 custom protocols
    will send your organization soaring into the 24th century."
- `/staff/tcpicism/docs`
  - Fake documentation
- `/staff/tcpicism/docs/quickstart`
  - Write as much as possible while providing literally zero information
- `/staff/tcpicism/docs/<int: port>`
  - Sort of "man" page for each port
  - Write folder of markdown files. Custom migration will load them all
    into the database.

With some easter eggs and diversions of course!

## TCP Protocols

- [ ] Write bash script or something to handle all the severs as subprocesses.
- [ ] Implement puzzles with documentation and tests as needed.

Follow this template for each:

### Spec

_A detail of the expected behavior of each protocol, which, time permitting,_
_will be also be implemented in a test._

### Flow

_A narrative of how the problem will be solved, including information that_
_must be included in documentation_
